## Codes of Conduct

When approaching the problem of a Code of Conduct for your company or your user
group it's often overwhelming to start. But there are so many great examples.
This is just a really quick reference of general and exceptional Codes of
Conduct from which you can borrow as you build your own.

### Organization

The following breaks down into three groups: UserGroups/Conferences, Corporate,
and Open Source. I feel each has a different interaction style, different
needs, and altogether different contexts.
